# Overview

The ContractionTimer app is designed to help individuals track and monitor contractions during labor, providing accurate data about the duration, frequency, and timing of contractions. This app empowers users by presenting their contraction patterns in an intuitive and organized way, helping them make informed decisions about when to head to the hospital or contact a healthcare provider.

The app provides a user-friendly interface with a timer to record contractions and a detailed summary of key statistics such as average duration, contractions per hour, and average frequency. The purpose of this app is to demonstrate advanced Android development skills while solving a real-world problem.

To use the app:

Open the app and tap "START" to begin timing a contraction.
Tap "STOP" once the contraction ends.
Each recorded contraction will appear in a list, showing its duration, frequency, and start time.
The top of the screen displays summary statistics for all recorded contractions.

# Purpose
The primary goal of creating this app was to strengthen Android development skills by implementing core features such as RecyclerView, ConstraintLayout, and managing data dynamically in a user-friendly UI. This project also helped in mastering efficient data binding and working with Android Studio's tools for seamless design and logic integration.

The secondary goal was to create a meaningful app that could potentially provide value in real-life scenarios, particularly for expecting parents or caregivers monitoring labor progress.
